# Working on `workfx`

Looking to join us in evolving and improving `work`? We put together a small guide to lay out the ground rules.

Let's do this! ðŸ¤“

## How do I report a bug?

Hey, nobody's perfect. As much as we test our code, a few bugs sneak past us. If you would like to report one you found, simply check our [Github issues](https://github.com/freerware/workfx/issues) that have the `bug` tag to see if someone beat you to it! Otherwise, whip one up with the following template:

```
## Description

[Description of the issue]

## Steps to Reproduce

1. [First Step]
2. [Second Step]
3. [and so on...]

## Expected behavior: [What you expect to happen]

## Actual behavior: [What actually happens]

## Versions

It can be super helpful to get an idea of your environment when troubleshooting issues. We ask you include the following versions:

- `Go` (`go version`)
- `dep` (`dep version`)
- the version of `workfx` you are using

## Additional Information

Any additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.
```

## How do I ask questions?

Great question. We suggest checking for any Github issues with the `question` tag to see if anyone has asked the same question before. When you're not finding what you are looking for, we ask that you create an issue with the `question` tag, so that others can benefit from the conversation.

## Where can I leave feedback?

We would enjoy hearing your thoughts on the work we have done so far, how you use `work`, and ideas you might have to make things better! Currently, just drop an email to the primary author at `freerjm@miamioh.edu`.

## How do I contribute changes?

Want to lend us a hand? We welcome pull requests for fixes and new features! All we ask is that your pull request hits these checklist items:

- [ ] Uses [well formed commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- [ ] Includes unit tests and maintains consistent or higher code coverage.
- [ ] Makes changes to both comments and other documentation where appropriate.
- [ ] Uses the following pull request template:

```
## Description

[Description of the enhancement]

## Rationale

[Rationale of why consumers need this feature or fix]

## Suggested Version

[Dialog describing whether the change requires a bump in major, minor, or patch version number]

## Example Usage
